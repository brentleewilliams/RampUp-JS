<h2>Brent is extremely particular about his outfits. Starting with the 1st day of summer, 
he wears a yellow shirt every 3rd day and a pink shirt every 7th day. 
On conflicting days (i.e. days that are multiples of both 3 and 7), 
he opts for his favorite blue tank instead.</h2>

<h3>Question 2</h3>
<p id="question1"> 
Ask the user to input the day of summer as an integer, 
and store it in a variable. Use a conditional to test for the various repsonses they could give, 
and alert what Brent will be wearing that day. Keep in mind a user may not input a number, 
and make sure your code is able to handle that with an appropriate response!</p>
